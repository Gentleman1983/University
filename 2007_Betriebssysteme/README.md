# Betriebssysteme
In 2007 and 2008 I had the course 'Betriebssysteme' (operating systems) by Mr. Brosenne. Here are the programmatic
solutions I did that time. Maybe there are some missing. Please beware the code quality and inspect the code before
running. After those time I won't expect if there were issues with it or maybe dangers for the system running the code.

Most tasks were done in **ANSI C** or **JAVA 6 or 7**.
