# Data-Mining in der Bio-Informatik
In 2010 I participated in the course 'Data-Mining in der Bio-Informatik' (data mining in bio informatics) by Mr.
Meineke. Here we learned some basics how to hande machine learning and data mining in the bio informatics context. 
The tasks have been done using **Octave** software.
