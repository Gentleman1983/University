# University
From 2006 to 2012 I went to the Georg-August University in GÃ¶ttingen for my Master of Science in 'Angewandter 
Informatik' (Applied Computer Sciences) with specialization in 'Wirtschaftsinformatik' (economic computer sciences).

I looked to my hard drive, if I may have to share some of the programming exercises from that time... ;) 

Maybe some of the exercises have gone missing over the past 10-16 years.
